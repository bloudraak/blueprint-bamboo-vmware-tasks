        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Its a suite of tasks that allows you to automate virtual machines hosted by a VMware vSphere hypervisor</p>
        <p>There are tasks for
          <ul>
            <li>Starting a virtual machine</li>
            <li>Powering off a virtual machine</li>
            <li>Shutting down the guest of the virtual machine</li>
            <li>Reverting the virtual machine to a snapshot</li>
            <li>Creating virtual machine snapshot</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <p>There are many times you'd like to run functional or integration tests after a build.  However, deploying a build on the build server itself is generally a bad idea.  These tasks allows you to define a virtual machine or three and deploy the build there. Since you can revert the virtual machine to a good snapshot, you can always revert the test machines back to a known state before deploying the build. It will reduce build failures.</p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>In order to run these tasks, you'll need
          <ul>
            <li><b>VMware vSphere 5.1</b> Unfortunately, the free edition of VMware vSphere hypervisor does not permit making changes to virtual machines. As a result, these tasks will not work against that version.  You need a fully paid version of VMware vSphere for this to work. It may work with older versions, but it has not been tested.</li>
            <li><b>Atlassian Bamboo 4.4</b> The tasks were tested with Atlassian Bamboo 4.4. It may work with previoous versions, but no guarentees are made.</li>
          </ul>
